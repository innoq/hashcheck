# HashCheck

HashCheck is basically a simple fork of Troy Hunts Pwned Passwords Service.
You can use it to test a users password against a dictionary file.
The file itself is accessed via a binary search, so searching in Troys ordered 30Gig txt file works fine.

## The Dictionary

Troys password files can be downloaded here: https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords
V2 contains 500+ million leaked password hashes.
Please make sure to download the _ordered by hash_ version.

File Format: `hash:value<whitespace-padding>`

## Installtion

Clone repository or Download
Download the ordered password list
`npm install`

## Startup

`FILE=./hashes.txt node app.js`

## Webinterface

The webinterface uses the browsers webcrypto API to send the password SHA1 hashed to the backend.
It displays a warning if the app is not delivered via https.

## API

The API consists of a simple endpoint where you can post a SHA1-Hash for lookup:

```Path: /check
Content-Type: application/json
Payload: {"hash":"40bd001563085fc35165329ea1ff5c5ecbdbbeef"}
Response
JSON
Not known: {"known":false}

```
